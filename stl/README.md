## 3D model files for Pumpkin Pi

There are 3 main components for the Pumpkin Pi.
 - [pumpkin-body.stl](pumpkin-body.stl) - the main body of the pumpkin. I printed without supports using glow in the dark PLA filament. Infil 15% gyroid pattern.
 - [pumpkin-pi-holder.stl](pumpkin-pi-holder.stl) - an insert that snap fits into the bottom of the pumpkin. I printed mine in the same run as the body with same settings.
 - [pumpkin-plug.stl](pumpkin-plug.stl) - the stalk part of the pumpkin that slots into the top. I printed mine in dark green PLA filament.
